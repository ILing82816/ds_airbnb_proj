Si, hablo bien espanol, Français parlé assez bien.The spaceDowntown Manhattan, .. just like you see it in the films. Only so much better in real life !!All the details are below so that will see all that you will experience on your trip to the Big Apple - there are lots of things you will love when you stay here, but PLEASE PLEASE (did I say please?) try to read all the way to the end of the description, including sleeping arrangements, information on the area, getting around and the frequently asked questions. I know it is a bit of a novel,  but it is well worth it and, from experience, it makes sure you understand everything in detail and ensures you will have the best stay that you can. Anything at all that you are not sure about, if you are new to Airbnb for example,  just ask and I will get back asap and clarify.• Very spacious loft apartment ( about 2000 sq feet, 188 sq m, at last measure - so very BIG for New York) in the center of arguably the coolest area of the city (please do not argue ), modern, minimalist furniture , very open, very clean, I take great pride in having a spotless living environment (that goes for the host too). A Massive space that gets flooded with light via a wall of windows. Just take a look at the pictures. High security. Walking distance to subways & museums. Friendly building and very safe neighborhood.• Your own PRIVATE bathroom -  Large, spacious, with Jacuzzi Bath, Shower, Hairdryer, Kohler fixtures. Fresh towels etc. Fully-stocked. All the shampoo and things you will ever need. Just for you.• Your own PRIVATE bedroom - Queen Bed for 2, firm and soft pillows for every type of sleeper, linens, towels, Large Flat Screen TV, Netflix, Amazon TV etc, Wardrobe. Again only for you. • Large kitchen - Open concept with an area to eat and with everything you need to design a gourmet feast, top of the line GE appliances, Microwave, Toaster, Kettle , Dishwasher, stainless steel counter top  etc. Make any food you want - if it is really good, give me some. Make coffee there in the morning - always available -- you have your very own little coffee bar.• Very large living area, Real Fireplace, WiFi, Surround sound HDTV with HDMI hook-up and Roku TV, Bose sound system with iPhone/iPod hook-up, the best choice in music (in my opinion, most not consulted). Sit.... Enjoy• Large dining area - seats lots, great views over the city and over the Williamsburg Bridge. Eat foods mentioned above (probably while seated, although one can never be sure).• Natural brick walls (as opposed to unnatural I suppose) and a lovely Merbeau wooden floor, both of which look good (but don't say much).• Floor to ceiling windows throughout - bathed in sun (when the sun is out, mainly, of course)• Outside secluded seating area and balcony - you access directly from your room - very secluded (sometimes I cannot find it)• Full air conditioning / heating in the room and in rest of loft - be hot, be cool (most likely one at a time)• Bosch Washer and Dryer - for you to use - we like to reserve that for guests who stay for 3 nights or longer - being kind to the world too, we try to use cold water as well where possible.• Keyed Private elevator entrance directly into Loft  - of course you have your own key (or stairs if u have the energy - does not seem so popular, strangely)• Printer / Scanner available. Pens and paper too, if you are a traditionalist.(although we draw the line at camel hair brushes, I'm sure you understand). And there is a universal power adapter for you to use to charge your gadgets too.• The building is a very smart development, a recently renovated 7-story apartment block with original brick facade, great  views of the city skyline. Quiet, lovely,  village feel, with parks and pedestrian areas just outside, but close enough to get anywhere very easily. I think I am allowed to say it is authentic. • This is a very large and comfortable space that you will be free to enjoy as you wish (this is your vacation after all). You will have lots of privacy and as well as the city,  you have Books, Music (great as mentioned above), Roku TV with lots of channels and an online DVR and more .... or just relax and chat. Up to you. We provide the following publications tooNew York Times New York Magazineso you can feel a bit like a New Yorker• Located in the heart of Downtown - food (some of the best in the city), drink, fun, shopping all very, very close. A very cool residential neighborhood just a short trip to all the action. Perfect location for exploring both sides of the river too, as very close to Brooklyn and Williamsburg. One of the most historic neighborhoods in the U.S. (perhaps the most). We are only a few minutes away from the walkway along the East River, it has a great view of the Brooklyn bridge and Manhattan Bridge. Nearly opposite the Tenement Museum (which is really great). TV, Film and general interest media all the time (become a star - or an extra anyway) ,music clubs and comedy left right and center and Alphabet City, Ludlow Street , East Village, Chinatown and Soho all in spitting distance - and I can not spit far. Direct Access to cabs just outside building.• Food shopping wise, it is 3 blocks from a Whole Foods, the largest Trader Joe's on the east coast and few blocks from the new Essex Street Market. Great food shopping if you want. I hope everything is covered - email if you need more information. I hope to see you soon and I hope I can be part of your visit to this unique place.Guest accessGuests have access to all they want  - the rest of the Loft , the eat-in kitchen, the dining room, living room, their own private bathroom and bedroom of course and the back deck (hanging from rooftop negotiable) Enjoy.Other things to noteFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSSome answers to some common questions  asked by prospective guests:• My calendar is ALWAYS updated, so if the apartment is listed as available, then it is. I work hard to make sure that all my information is as accurate and clear as is possible. If you could try to make sure you read the entire listing as it not only answers most questions, but also makes the stay here much more enjoyable - as I have found in my time welcoming many many guests from all over the world.  • If you are getting here early or late, I am happy to accommodate. If you get here early, for example (before the room is ready at 3 pm), you will be able to check in, get the keys, and leave your bags and enjoy the city and the room will be available at the check in time - if the room is ready earlier I will of course inform you. This works for when you are leaving too, for example if you flight takes off late. In this case I am happy to have you leave your bags and take the keys and return simply to pick up the bags to get to the airport or train station etc on time. It is all part of the service with no charge so you dont have to pay to store stuff, lug it around with you and you get chance to enjoy the city till the last moment. • Once you enter the dates and number of guests, AirBnb will give you an accurate price and show all costs including AirBnb fees. If you want to see how the total is calculated, the area on the right of the screen under the pictures shows the total and will detail what the breakdown is - you can get access to this easily via drop-down next to the total price, giving you a clear picture of all that you will be charged.• I don't give preset weekly discounts but, if you are planning to stay for a longish time, I am prepared to offer special prices, so please do email and ask. • I never charge for cleaning (unless you specifically want me to, of course). I think this a little unfair and the place is always kept very very clean. • You will have lots of privacy, I sleep in separate area within the Loft with a separate bathroom and entertainment area. You won't keep me awake, nor will you need to tip-toe around. You will have lots of privacy p, but with a great guide to the city right there, to make sure that you can get tips and tricks from a local about things to do during your stay, making sure you can you explore NY properly, know hidden places to visit and the best and most up to date places to go (and dare I say it avoid all traps that await the tourist)• I have recently made the loft available to more guests than the 2 we usually have staying in the Queen Bed in the guest bedroom  - previous guests have told me that they would love to bring friends or children with them and having stayed here, they said that the place is more than comfortable and spacious enough to do so. I have therefore added the use of the Queen size sofa-bed, together with the use of one of our two (depending what size you want) top-notch  Airbeds that we have used in the past (to popular acclaim), both of which I have been told are extremely comfortable.  The sofa-bed etc will be screened off to make it as a separate bedroom and there is enough space in the loft so that you can decide where to put either of the airbeds. The site makes this clear with simple icons that show you options for use of beds, but if there are any questions please ask. I have made the price for these extra beds (sofa-bed or the air-bed) substantially lower than the bedroom and, if you do wish to use them,  the pricing for and reservation of them will be automatic (for example if you specify 3 or more people, that third person will be taking the sofa bed).  NOTE: It will be assumed that, if there are 2 people staying, they will be sharing the bed in the bedroom. If there are 3, 4 or 5 people staying, it will be assumed that there will be two people to each bed  -- if either of these are NOT the case please (e.g only two are staying but they wish to have separate beds) please do let me know as this means that we will need to use more beds and there will a small  incremental charges for this, primarily for extra time setting up and for usage of sheets, washing etc .  I am however always happy to discuss exactly what you need , via an email or two,  to make it work. I urge you to contact me before you book , if you are not clear about anything or there are any questions that you have that you do feel are not covered. See you soon, I hope./ Downtown, the best bit of Manhattan. One of, if not the,  LARGEST space on Airbnb in NYC.

The neighborhood is changing, but maintains it authentic NYC flavor intermingled with young professionals and the actors that stock Broadway's plays.  The apartment is located in Washington Heights, 2 blocks (3 to 4 minute walk) from the A express train and 1 and C local trains.

Penthouse because it’s the entire top floor, not because there's a helipad and a pool. :) This is Brooklyn. But I think you’ll like it for the reasons I do: five trains within a 5-min walk, a rooftop facing Manhattan, live music everywhere, late-night restaurants, McCarren park nearby and the atmosphere of a real neighborhood. After seven years (five as a host), I still love it. You will too!The spaceIMPORTANT UPDATES: 1) 5 Day Maximum Rental - No Exceptions. Please, no inquiries regarding extended or long-term stays.2) Airbnb has changed their display pricing and are showing customers my rooms at $10-20 a night. This is not the regular rate, it's the last minute price I may have set recently and doesn't include the cleaning fee that we can't manually set based on length of stay and is $50 for laundry and cleaning. This brings the price to it's normal level for my average guests who stay about a week.DESCRIPTION:DIY IS YOUR FRIEND- You'll notice this as soon as you come into the apartment. James and I loved building things and putting the apartment together with our own touches. The living room cocktail table we brought from central Brooklyn on the subway and spent four days sanding, cleaning, painting and constructing it into a table. You'll see touches like this all over the apartment. HAVE YOUR CARRIE BRADSHAW MOMENT- Pop out the window in the living room like Carrie and have a smoke on the fire escape or watch the sunset, or climb up to the roof and have a martini (we usually drink margaritas up there) and have a great NYC moment. BOUJI TO BUSTED- Have drinks on the roof of the Wythe Hotel for $14 and look out over all of Williamburg or spend $5 and get a PBR and a shot at Union Cafe with a taco in their back garden and listen to some live music. This neighborhood caters to the whole spectrum and you can eat til 2 am and drink til 4 am. LOWER MANHATTAN IS 1 STOP AWAY- 5 Train lines within a 5 minute walk of the apartment, the J, M, Z and G, L so getting into Manhattan is easy and the trains run 24 hours a day. ENJOY YOUR PRIVACY- If you want to have a chat catch me when I'm having a cocktail on the weekends and getting ready to go out and we'll have a laugh, but other than that you have privacy and I let you do your thing while I recharge during the week in my space doing mine. 4 YEARS OF AIRBNB HOSTING - 2000+ GUESTS- Yep. That's right. Been doing this for 4 years and have had over 2000 guests so it’s a pretty well oiled machine.Hope to meet you soon! If you have any questions, ask away!Guest access- Bathroom(Clean your hair out of the shower though. Yikes! I'm bald and this gets nasty to see. Thanks!)- Kitchen (Cook away or store your takeaway in the fridge. But do your dishes. Only I get to be lazy on occasion and don't...joke. Not really. I mean I'm human and sometimes you just wanna get to the Haagen Dasz.)- Living Room(Try to be respectful if it's late.)- Rooftop(Love this in the summer, but bring anything you bring up, back down. We BBQ up there sometimes and its fun!)- Your RoomOther things to note- Street parking is easy and available. But you have to move your car Tuesday's and Friday's 9:00am-10:30am for street cleaning. When you confirm the room the airbnb guide we completed has our favorite restaurants nearby, fun places we like to go, music and bars that we've done plenty of personal research to find. Guests that have checked out the restaurants in particular have really been pleased.We've had a handful of people who are new to being guests through Airbnb and I think its important to know several things. The heat is via radiators since the building is traditional brick three story so can be uneven, so we've added a safe electrical heater in the room and guests have said its more than adequate to get the room toasty hot. Also, smoking is permitted on the firescape up to the roof but not in the apartment. LGBT friendly!EARLY CHECK-IN & BAG DROP/LUGGAGE STORAGE AFTER CHECK OUT/LATE ARRIVAL:We offer these optional services at an additional cost. The terms and details are outlined in the welcome message after you book. INTERNATIONAL TRAVELLERS: If you are interested in the room you can expect a response very quickly between 10:00am-7:00pm NYC time, a few people were sad they booked with others before they heard from me but it was 4am my time when it came in and I'm not checking my email til about 10 am daily and then as often in the evening. Just to let you know.PROFESSIONAL USAGE / NON-STANDARD - Only permitted with my prior agreed upon permission.

We are on a quiet street and you'll have the entire apartment to yourself. Unlike many NYC Airbnb listings, this listing is 100% legal. This is a family owned building, and we all live here so there is no need to sneak around your neighbors. We have ""smart locks"" so you can open the building and apartment with your smartphone. Details will follow once you've booked.Other things to noteHere are the most common questions that guests have: *How will we get into the apartment?*The building has a 'smart' lock with a code so that you can arrive anytime without having to arrange a specific meeting time. Then we leave the keys for you in the apartment. Very easy!*Can I drop off my bags early, or leave them after checkout?*Yes sure! Checkin is anytime after 3pm and checkout is anytime before 11am, but if you arrive before 3pm you can leave your bags in the entrance area of  the building... If  you have a late flight and want to leave your bags after 11am in the entrance area that's also ok.*What about food? Is there a kitchen?*There is no kitchen, and if you are hoping to cook meals for yourself then you need a bigger Airbnb... If you are a short term visitor who plans to enjoy the city's restaurants then this is the perfect place for you! We provide a mini fridge and coffee machine, there are tons of restaurants in walking distance, and you can be like a New Yorker and download an app called ""Seamless"" to order food delivery from literally hundreds of restaurants.*Is there an elevator?*Nope. The apartment is on the rooftop of a classic Brooklyn brownstone. It's about 60 steps from the entrance of the building to the apartment. Don't worry: millions of New Yorkers deal with stairs every day. Welcome to New York! :)*Is the roof deck private?*No it is a shared roof deck that is open to anyone in the building. However this is a very small family building so most of the time no one is up there, and when they are up there you can meet some very nice people :). There are full blackout curtains so you have 100% privacy even when someone is on the roof deck. *What is an Apple TV?*An Apple TV is a 'Smart TV' which allows you to watch tens of thousands of movies and TV shows through services like Netflix and Hulu (which we provide). So it's perfect for watching movies and catching up on TV shows but it does *not* allow you to watch live or cable TV (news, sports, etc). *What about sheets and towels?*Fresh sheets, towels, and blankets are provided.*Where can I do laundry?*There is a laundromat less than one block from us. They have a cheap “wash and fold” service. *Why is there a cleaning fee?*  We charge a small cleaning fee because we keep the apartment very clean and have it professionally cleaned before you arrive. This cost is built into the quote you see from Airbnb.*Is this a legal Airbnb?* Yes. You may have heard of NYC Airbnbs that are not legal and where you have to be careful talking to the neighbors. That's because many Airbnb apartments in NYC are people who are renting in large apartment buildings, and doing Airbnb without the landlord's permission... This is a small, 2  family building, and we live on the floor right under, so everything is perfectly normal.

We turn what was a 3 bedroom apt. into one very spacious one bedroom open concept apt. while keeping the kitchen and living room separate from the bedroom for privacy.

Penthouse because it’s the entire top floor, not because there's a helipad and a pool. :) This is Brooklyn. But I think you’ll like it for the reasons I do: five trains within a 5-min walk, a rooftop facing Manhattan, live music everywhere, late-night restaurants, McCarren park nearby and the atmosphere of a real neighborhood. After seven years (five as a host), I still love it. You will too!The spaceIMPORTANT UPDATES: 1) 5 Day Maximum Rental - No Exceptions. Please, no inquiries regarding extended or long-term stays.2) Airbnb has changed their display pricing and are showing customers my rooms at $10-20 a night. This is not the regular rate, it's the last minute price I may have set recently and doesn't include the cleaning fee that we can't manually set based on length of stay and is $50 for laundry and cleaning. This brings the price to it's normal level for my average guests who stay about a week.DESCRIPTION:DIY IS YOUR FRIEND- You'll notice this as soon as you come into the apartment. James and I loved building things and putting the apartment together with our own touches. The living room cocktail table we brought from central Brooklyn on the subway and spent four days sanding, cleaning, painting and constructing it into a table. You'll see touches like this all over the apartment. HAVE YOUR CARRIE BRADSHAW MOMENT- Pop out the window in the living room like Carrie and have a smoke on the fire escape or watch the sunset, or climb up to the roof and have a martini (we usually drink margaritas up there) and have a great NYC moment. BOUJI TO BUSTED- Have drinks on the roof of the Wythe Hotel for $14 and look out over all of Williamburg or spend $5 and get a PBR and a shot at Union Cafe with a taco in their back garden and listen to some live music. This neighborhood caters to the whole spectrum and you can eat til 2 am and drink til 4 am. LOWER MANHATTAN IS 1 STOP AWAY- 5 Train lines within a 5 minute walk of the apartment, the J, M, Z and G, L so getting into Manhattan is easy and the trains run 24 hours a day. ENJOY YOUR PRIVACY- If you want to have a chat catch me when I'm having a cocktail on the weekends and getting ready to go out and we'll have a laugh, but other than that you have privacy and I let you do your thing while I recharge during the week in my space doing mine. 4 YEARS OF AIRBNB HOSTING - 2000+ GUESTS- Yep. That's right. Been doing this for 4 years and have had over 2000 guests so it’s a pretty well oiled machine.Hope to meet you soon! If you have any questions, ask away!Guest access- Bathroom(Clean your hair out of the shower though. Yikes! I'm bald and this gets nasty to see. Thanks!)- Kitchen (Cook away or store your takeaway in the fridge. But do your dishes. Only I get to be lazy on occasion and don't...joke. Not really. I mean I'm human and sometimes you just wanna get to the Haagen Dasz.)- Living Room(Try to be respectful if it's late.)- Rooftop(Love this in the summer, but bring anything you bring up, back down. We BBQ up there sometimes and its fun!)- Your RoomOther things to note- Street parking is easy and available. But you have to move your car Tuesday's and Friday's 9:00am-10:30am for street cleaning. When you confirm the room the airbnb guide we completed has our favorite restaurants nearby, fun places we like to go, music and bars that we've done plenty of personal research to find. Guests that have checked out the restaurants in particular have really been pleased.We've had a handful of people who are new to being guests through Airbnb and I think its important to know several things. The heat is via radiators since the building is traditional brick three story so can be uneven, so we've added a safe electrical heater in the room and guests have said its more than adequate to get the room toasty hot. Also, smoking is permitted on the firescape up to the roof but not in the apartment. LGBT friendly!EARLY CHECK-IN & BAG DROP/LUGGAGE STORAGE AFTER CHECK OUT/LATE ARRIVAL:We offer these optional services at an additional cost. The terms and details are outlined in the welcome message after you book. INTERNATIONAL TRAVELLERS: If you are interested in the room you can expect a response very quickly between 10:00am-7:00pm NYC time, a few people were sad they booked with others before they heard from me but it was 4am my time when it came in and I'm not checking my email til about 10 am daily and then as often in the evening.

I love hearing updates about cities where I’ve lived, and I like learning about places I’ve yet to visit. The East Village is a good fit for me. It attracts all types. On my block you’ll find young families, grandparents, college kids, native New Yorkers, nomads, immigrants, hippies, filmmakers, punk rockers, artists, chefs, businessmen, white collar, blue collar, no collar, you name it. The more different their background is from mine, the more I like meeting them. I’m very familiar with Lower Manhattan, and I’m happy to show you around, especially if you're up for a food crawl. If you skate, you’re welcome to borrow one of my boards. It’s a great way to explore. Whether you book with me or not, I hope you consider staying in the East Village. You’ll see a cross-section of life and culture you won’t find anywhere else in Manhattan. If you like striking a balance between adventure and comfort, the East Village will provide the former, and my apartment will provide the latter. Also, in case you were wondering, my name is pronounced ""snay."" Enjoy your visit!/ I surf. I skateboard to work. I make awesome grilled cheeses.

Read the thorough room description below for details about this.

Your bedroom will be private, but YOU WILL BE SHARING THE COMMON AREAS of the apartment if the other, smaller guest room is booked for the same time period. Please read below FIRST for full details.=====================PLEASE CONTACT ME FIRST (via the ""Contact Host"" button below the photo of me; do not submit a booking request) with:1. any questions,2. the dates of your visit,3. the name of your traveling companion, and4. your approximate arrival time BEFORE making an actual booking request (via the ""Request to Book"" button). Please complete the OFFICIAL AIRBNB VERIFICATION PROCESS at -- www.airbnb.com/verify -- BEFORE CONTACTING ME. I need to see the official GREEN ICON WITH CHECKMARK on your COMPLETED PROFILE before I will consider your inquiry.If you make a booking request before contacting me and then getting a response with an invitation to submit a booking request, I regret that I will have to decline your booking request.My guest room is in an excellent location, a great value and an extremely popular booking--all of which you can see in my glowing reviews. Sometimes my calendar may show dates available, but I may actually be holding those dates for someone who has already contacted me first. In fairness, I always accept booking requests for the same dates in the order received.Also--and THIS IS IMPORTANT--I will never extend an invitation to make a booking request to anyone who doesn't have his or her profile completed with:1) a clear personal photo (of yourself--not of the mountains or your dog or flowers or...);2) COMPLETED Airbnb verification--the OFFICIAL AIRBNB VERIFICATION PROCESS in the form of identification, verified phone number, email address, etc.: https://www.airbnb.com/verify; and,3) some personal information so that I have an idea of whom I might be inviting into my home.Please make sure of this BEFORE contacting me.One final note--because I have had a couple of recent bookings where the guests informed me of a late-night arrival AFTER booking the room--I generally cannot accommodate late-night arrivals in this apartment. If your flight, bus, train or other mode of transportation will have you arriving at night (especially international flights arriving in the late evening) and arriving at the apartment at a late hour, I apologize in advance, but I will not be able to accommodate a late check-in.=====================This guest room is the larger, private bedroom in my apartment in the East Village. (Also see my other listing for the smaller guest room in this same apartment: ""Cozy Room in Lively East Village"".) The room is comfortably furnished with a full/double size bed with a premium, relaxing, restful, plush euro pillowtop mattress--not some cheap, hard mattress with springs poking you in the back all night and barely any cushioning! Additionally, there's a wardrobe and dresser in the room if you'd like to fully unpack your suitcase and get comfortable.This larger bedroom faces the street, and it gets wonderful natural light during the day. There is some general city noise that can sometimes be heard--after all, you are choosing to stay in Manhattan and not out in the suburbs or countryside--but at night the blackout curtains help to reduce (but not eliminate) the sounds of the city. Some guests may need ear plugs at night while others will not.Fresh, quality bed linens and towels are provided for your stay, as is WiFi. Additionally, there is an iron and hair dryer available for shared use. In the kitchen you'll find a delicious selection of mostly organic teas for your enjoyment. You are absolutely welcome to make use of the kitchen to prepare any meals, if you wish, and you are invited to get comfortable in the living room area and read a book or watch television. In the bedroom you will find a power strip that has four USB ports to charge your electronics and two electrical outlets with international adapters built in to accommodate most all various worldwide electrical plugs. Who's got you covered? I do!My apartment is a fairly typical NYC flat--not huge but very welcoming, warm, safe and clean (earth-friendly, cruelty-free products are used). Typical smaller, older, downtown apartment buildings like this one don't have an elevator/lift--but this one does (as of a couple of years ago!) to make transporting your luggage upstairs easy or if you have problems with stairs.Your host--that would be me--is a genuinely kind, friendly, former Midwesterner who wants to make sure your visit to this fabulous city is wonderful (I hope you love it as much as I do!) and that your stay in my home is as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. In short, while you are visiting, my home is your home.Please notice that I'm not just a host--I'm a Superhost. That means that I've earned the Superhost badge from Airbnb (added by Airbnb to my profile) and go above and beyond Airbnb's standards of quality that is required from hosts, doing what I can to ensure your stay is more-than-comfortable and helping to make it a 5-star experience.Situated on East 10th Street, the location is convenient to all that this city has to offer. The L train is a less-than-5-minute walk away, and Tompkins Square Park is right around the corner. Within a short walking distance is Union Square, Greenwich Village, the Lower East Side, Chinatown, SoHo, Washington Square Park and more! Subway trains that are very close include the L, 4, 5, 6, F, N, R, Q, all of which will connect you wherever you want to go in a snap!For your convenience, the neighborhood offers plenty of restaurants (including vegetarian/vegan, Thai, Japanese, Mexican, pizza, falafels, diners and much more), grocery stores (including Whole Foods and Trader Joe's), farmer's markets, coffee shops, 24-hour delis and pharmacies, off-Broadway theatres, cinemas, nightlife options and more.Guest accessThis is the larger of TWO guest rooms in this apartment. Your bedroom will be private, but YOU WILL BE SHARING THE COMMON AREAS of the apartment--bathroom, kitchen and living room areas.Other things to note1. The room itself is about 9.5'x14' (about 135 sq. feet/12.5 sq meters), and there are two guest rooms in the apartment.2. Your bedroom is private, but YOU WILL BE SHARING THE COMMON AREAS of the apartment (bathroom, kitchen and living room) if there is another guest in the other guest room for the same time period. If this is an issue for you, then do not book this room.3. If I am not traveling, then I personally tidy up my place every day or every other one to clean the common areas and to make sure things are stocked (teas, hand soap, paper towels, toilet tissue, etc.) and garbage and recyclables are removed. I do ask that you help me keep the place clean by picking up after yourself and disposing of trash and recyclables in their proper places.The place is super-convenient as noted above, has an awesome host (if I may say so myself) and is a great value.I enjoy meeting different people, and I look forward to welcoming you as a guest into my home./ Please DO NOT SUBMIT A BOOKING REQUEST WITHOUT CONTACTING ME FIRST.

Read the thorough room description below for details about this. I ask to chat with potential guests first to check about arrival times and answer any questions before I then extend an invitation to submit a booking request.COVID-19 UPDATE:If you are interested in the full apartment, let's discuss.Also, please complete the OFFICIAL AIRBNB VERIFICATION PROCESS at -- www.airbnb.com/verify -- BEFORE CONTACTING ME.The space——————————COVID-19 UPDATE:During these crazy times, if you are interested in the full apartment (this room and the other, larger guest room--if both are not yet booked for your dates), please reach out to me to discuss.——————————This is the LARGER of TWO guest rooms in this apartment. Your bedroom will be private, but YOU WILL BE SHARING THE COMMON AREAS of the apartment if the other, smaller guest room is booked for the same time period. Please read below FIRST for full details.=====================PLEASE CONTACT ME FIRST (via the ""Contact Host"" button below the photo of me; do not submit a booking request) with:1. any questions,2. the dates of your visit,3. the name of your traveling companion, and4. your approximate arrival time BEFORE making an actual booking request (via the ""Request to Book"" button). Please complete the OFFICIAL AIRBNB VERIFICATION PROCESS at -- www.airbnb.com/verify -- BEFORE CONTACTING ME. I need to see the official GREEN ICON WITH CHECKMARK on your COMPLETED PROFILE before I will consider your inquiry.If you make a booking request before contacting me and then getting a response with an invitation to submit a booking request, I regret that I will have to decline your booking request.My guest room is in an excellent location, a great value and an extremely popular booking--all of which you can see in my glowing reviews. Sometimes my calendar may show dates available, but I may actually be holding those dates for someone who has already contacted me first. In fairness, I always accept booking requests for the same dates in the order received.Also--and THIS IS IMPORTANT--I will never extend an invitation to make a booking request to anyone who doesn't have his or her profile completed with:1) a clear personal photo (of yourself--not of the mountains or your dog or flowers or...);2) COMPLETED Airbnb verification--the OFFICIAL AIRBNB VERIFICATION PROCESS in the form of identification, verified phone number, email address, etc.: https://www.airbnb.com/verify; and,3) some personal information so that I have an idea of whom I might be inviting into my home.Please make sure of this BEFORE contacting me.One final note--because I have had a couple of recent bookings where the guests informed me of a late-night arrival AFTER booking the room--I generally cannot accommodate late-night arrivals in this apartment. If your flight, bus, train or other mode of transportation will have you arriving at night (especially international flights arriving in the late evening) and arriving at the apartment at a late hour, I apologize in advance, but I will not be able to accommodate a late check-in.=====================This guest room is the larger, private bedroom in my apartment in the East Village. (Also see my other listing for the smaller guest room in this same apartment: ""Cozy Room in Lively East Village"".) The room is comfortably furnished with a full/double size bed with a premium, relaxing, restful, plush euro pillowtop mattress--not some cheap, hard mattress with springs poking you in the back all night and barely any cushioning! Additionally, there's a wardrobe and dresser in the room if you'd like to fully unpack your suitcase and get comfortable.This larger bedroom faces the street, and it gets wonderful natural light during the day. There is some general city noise that can sometimes be heard--after all, you are choosing to stay in Manhattan and not out in the suburbs or countryside--but at night the blackout curtains help to reduce (but not eliminate) the sounds of the city. Some guests may need ear plugs at night while others will not.Fresh, quality bed linens and towels are provided for your stay, as is WiFi. Additionally, there is an iron and hair dryer available for shared use. In the kitchen you'll find a delicious selection of mostly organic teas for your enjoyment. You are absolutely welcome to make use of the kitchen to prepare any meals, if you wish, and you are invited to get comfortable in the living room area and read a book or watch television. In the bedroom you will find a power strip that has four USB ports to charge your electronics and two electrical outlets with international adapters built in to accommodate most all various worldwide electrical plugs. Who's got you covered? I do!My apartment is a fairly typical NYC flat--not huge but very welcoming, warm, safe and clean (earth-friendly, cruelty-free products are used). Typical smaller, older, downtown apartment buildings like this one don't have an elevator/lift--but this one does (as of a couple of years ago!) to make transporting your luggage upstairs easy or if you have problems with stairs.Your host--that would be me--is a genuinely kind, friendly, former Midwesterner who wants to make sure your visit to this fabulous city is wonderful (I hope you love it as much as I do!) and that your stay in my home is as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. In short, while you are visiting, my home is your home.Please notice that I'm not just a host--I'm a Superhost. That means that I've earned the Superhost badge from Airbnb (added by Airbnb to my profile) and go above and beyond Airbnb's standards of quality that is required from hosts, doing what I can to ensure your stay is more-than-comfortable and helping to make it a 5-star experience.Situated on East 10th Street, the location is convenient to all that this city has to offer. The L train is a less-than-5-minute walk away, and Tompkins Square Park is right around the corner. Within a short walking distance is Union Square, Greenwich Village, the Lower East Side, Chinatown, SoHo, Washington Square Park and more! Subway trains that are very close include the L, 4, 5, 6, F, N, R, Q, all of which will connect you wherever you want to go in a snap!For your convenience, the neighborhood offers plenty of restaurants (including vegetarian/vegan, Thai, Japanese, Mexican, pizza, falafels, diners and much more), grocery stores (including Whole Foods and Trader Joe's), farmer's markets, coffee shops, 24-hour delis and pharmacies, off-Broadway theatres, cinemas, nightlife options and more.Guest accessThis is the larger of TWO guest rooms in this apartment. Your bedroom will be private, but YOU WILL BE SHARING THE COMMON AREAS of the apartment--bathroom, kitchen and living room areas.Other things to note1. The room itself is about 9.5'x14' (about 135 sq. feet/12.5 sq meters), and there are two guest rooms in the apartment.2. Your bedroom is private, but YOU WILL BE SHARING THE COMMON AREAS of the apartment (bathroom, kitchen and living room) if there is another guest in the other guest room for the same time period. If this is an issue for you, then do not book this room.3. If I am not traveling, then I personally tidy up my place every day or every other one to clean the common areas and to make sure things are stocked (teas, hand soap, paper towels, toilet tissue, etc.) and garbage and recyclables are removed. I do ask that you help me keep the place clean by picking up after yourself and disposing of trash and recyclables in their proper places.The place is super-convenient as noted above, has an awesome host (if I may say so myself) and is a great value.I enjoy meeting different people, and I look forward to welcoming you as a guest into my home./ Please DO NOT SUBMIT A BOOKING REQUEST WITHOUT CONTACTING ME FIRST.

Read the thorough room description below for details about this. I ask to chat with potential guests first to check about arrival times and answer any questions before I then extend an invitation to submit a booking request.COVID-19 UPDATE:If you are interested in the full apartment, let's discuss.Also, please complete the OFFICIAL AIRBNB VERIFICATION PROCESS at -- www.airbnb.com/verify -- BEFORE CONTACTING ME.The space——————————COVID-19 UPDATE:During these crazy times, if you are interested in the full apartment (this room and the other, larger guest room--if both are not yet booked for your dates), please reach out to me to discuss.——————————This is the LARGER of TWO guest rooms in this apartment. Your bedroom will be private, but YOU WILL BE SHARING THE COMMON AREAS of the apartment if the other, smaller guest room is booked for the same time period. Please read below FIRST for full details.=====================PLEASE CONTACT ME FIRST (via the ""Contact Host"" button below the photo of me; do not submit a booking request) with:1. any questions,2. the dates of your visit,3. the name of your traveling companion, and4. your approximate arrival time BEFORE making an actual booking request (via the ""Request to Book"" button). Please complete the OFFICIAL AIRBNB VERIFICATION PROCESS at -- www.airbnb.com/verify -- BEFORE CONTACTING ME. I need to see the official GREEN ICON WITH CHECKMARK on your COMPLETED PROFILE before I will consider your inquiry.If you make a booking request before contacting me and then getting a response with an invitation to submit a booking request, I regret that I will have to decline your booking request.My guest room is in an excellent location, a great value and an extremely popular booking--all of which you can see in my glowing reviews. Sometimes my calendar may show dates available, but I may actually be holding those dates for someone who has already contacted me first. In fairness, I always accept booking requests for the same dates in the order received.Also--and THIS IS IMPORTANT--I will never extend an invitation to make a booking request to anyone who doesn't have his or her profile completed with:1) a clear personal photo (of yourself--not of the mountains or your dog or flowers or...);2) COMPLETED Airbnb verification--the OFFICIAL AIRBNB VERIFICATION PROCESS in the form of identification, verified phone number, email address, etc.: https://www.airbnb.com/verify; and,3) some personal information so that I have an idea of whom I might be inviting into my home.Please make sure of this BEFORE contacting me.One final note--because I have had a couple of recent bookings where the guests informed me of a late-night arrival AFTER booking the room--I generally cannot accommodate late-night arrivals in this apartment. If your flight, bus, train or other mode of transportation will have you arriving at night (especially international flights arriving in the late evening) and arriving at the apartment at a late hour, I apologize in advance, but I will not be able to accommodate a late check-in.=====================This guest room is the larger, private bedroom in my apartment in the East Village. (Also see my other listing for the smaller guest room in this same apartment: ""Cozy Room in Lively East Village"".) The room is comfortably furnished with a full/double size bed with a premium, relaxing, restful, plush euro pillowtop mattress--not some cheap, hard mattress with springs poking you in the back all night and barely any cushioning! Additionally, there's a wardrobe and dresser in the room if you'd like to fully unpack your suitcase and get comfortable.This larger bedroom faces the street, and it gets wonderful natural light during the day. There is some general city noise that can sometimes be heard--after all, you are choosing to stay in Manhattan and not out in the suburbs or countryside--but at night the blackout curtains help to reduce (but not eliminate) the sounds of the city. Some guests may need ear plugs at night while others will not.Fresh, quality bed linens and towels are provided for your stay, as is WiFi. Additionally, there is an iron and hair dryer available for shared use. In the kitchen you'll find a delicious selection of mostly organic teas for your enjoyment. You are absolutely welcome to make use of the kitchen to prepare any meals, if you wish, and you are invited to get comfortable in the living room area and read a book or watch television. In the bedroom you will find a power strip that has four USB ports to charge your electronics and two electrical outlets with international adapters built in to accommodate most all various worldwide electrical plugs. Who's got you covered? I do!My apartment is a fairly typical NYC flat--not huge but very welcoming, warm, safe and clean (earth-friendly, cruelty-free products are used). Typical smaller, older, downtown apartment buildings like this one don't have an elevator/lift--but this one does (as of a couple of years ago!) to make transporting your luggage upstairs easy or if you have problems with stairs.Your host--that would be me--is a genuinely kind, friendly, former Midwesterner who wants to make sure your visit to this fabulous city is wonderful (I hope you love it as much as I do!) and that your stay in my home is as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. In short, while you are visiting, my home is your home.Please notice that I'm not just a host--I'm a Superhost. That means that I've earned the Superhost badge from Airbnb (added by Airbnb to my profile) and go above and beyond Airbnb's standards of quality that is required from hosts, doing what I can to ensure your stay is more-than-comfortable and helping to make it a 5-star experience.Situated on East 10th Street, the location is convenient to all that this city has to offer. The L train is a less-than-5-minute walk away, and Tompkins Square Park is right around the corner. Within a short walking distance is Union Square, Greenwich Village, the Lower East Side, Chinatown, SoHo, Washington Square Park and more! Subway trains that are very close include the L, 4, 5, 6, F, N, R, Q, all of which will connect you wherever you want to go in a snap!For your convenience, the neighborhood offers plenty of restaurants (including vegetarian/vegan, Thai, Japanese, Mexican, pizza, falafels, diners and much more), grocery stores (including Whole Foods and Trader Joe's), farmer's markets, coffee shops, 24-hour delis and pharmacies, off-Broadway theatres, cinemas, nightlife options and more.Guest accessThis is the larger of TWO guest rooms in this apartment. Your bedroom will be private, but YOU WILL BE SHARING THE COMMON AREAS of the apartment--bathroom, kitchen and living room areas.Other things to note1. The room itself is about 9.5'x14' (about 135 sq. feet/12.5 sq meters), and there are two guest rooms in the apartment.2. Your bedroom is private, but YOU WILL BE SHARING THE COMMON AREAS of the apartment (bathroom, kitchen and living room) if there is another guest in the other guest room for the same time period. If this is an issue for you, then do not book this room.3. If I am not traveling, then I personally tidy up my place every day or every other one to clean the common areas and to make sure things are stocked (teas, hand soap, paper towels, toilet tissue, etc.) and garbage and recyclables are removed. I do ask that you help me keep the place clean by picking up after yourself and disposing of trash and recyclables in their proper places.The place is super-convenient as noted above, has an awesome host (if I may say so myself) and is a great value.I enjoy meeting different people, and I look forward to welcoming you as a guest into my home./ Please DO NOT SUBMIT A BOOKING REQUEST WITHOUT CONTACTING ME FIRST.

Read the thorough room description below for details about this. I ask to chat with potential guests first to check about arrival times and answer any questions before I then extend an invitation to submit a booking request.COVID-19 UPDATE:If you are interested in the full apartment, let's discuss.Also, please complete the OFFICIAL AIRBNB VERIFICATION PROCESS at -- www.airbnb.com/verify -- BEFORE CONTACTING ME.The space——————————COVID-19 UPDATE:During these crazy times, if you are interested in the full apartment (this room and the other, larger guest room--if both are not yet booked for your dates), please reach out to me to discuss.——————————This is the LARGER of TWO guest rooms in this apartment. Your bedroom will be private, but YOU WILL BE SHARING THE COMMON AREAS of the apartment if the other, smaller guest room is booked for the same time period. Please read below FIRST for full details.=====================PLEASE CONTACT ME FIRST (via the ""Contact Host"" button below the photo of me; do not submit a booking request) with:1. any questions,2. the dates of your visit,3. the name of your traveling companion, and4. your approximate arrival time BEFORE making an actual booking request (via the ""Request to Book"" button). Please complete the OFFICIAL AIRBNB VERIFICATION PROCESS at -- www.airbnb.com/verify -- BEFORE CONTACTING ME. I need to see the official GREEN ICON WITH CHECKMARK on your COMPLETED PROFILE before I will consider your inquiry.If you make a booking request before contacting me and then getting a response with an invitation to submit a booking request, I regret that I will have to decline your booking request.My guest room is in an excellent location, a great value and an extremely popular booking--all of which you can see in my glowing reviews. Sometimes my calendar may show dates available, but I may actually be holding those dates for someone who has already contacted me first. In fairness, I always accept booking requests for the same dates in the order received.Also--and THIS IS IMPORTANT--I will never extend an invitation to make a booking request to anyone who doesn't have his or her profile completed with:1) a clear personal photo (of yourself--not of the mountains or your dog or flowers or...);2) COMPLETED Airbnb verification--the OFFICIAL AIRBNB VERIFICATION PROCESS in the form of identification, verified phone number, email address, etc.: https://www.airbnb.com/verify; and,3) some personal information so that I have an idea of whom I might be inviting into my home.Please make sure of this BEFORE contacting me.One final note--because I have had a couple of recent bookings where the guests informed me of a late-night arrival AFTER booking the room--I generally cannot accommodate late-night arrivals in this apartment. If your flight, bus, train or other mode of transportation will have you arriving at night (especially international flights arriving in the late evening) and arriving at the apartment at a late hour, I apologize in advance, but I will not be able to accommodate a late check-in.=====================This guest room is the larger, private bedroom in my apartment in the East Village. (Also see my other listing for the smaller guest room in this same apartment: ""Cozy Room in Lively East Village"".) The room is comfortably furnished with a full/double size bed with a premium, relaxing, restful, plush euro pillowtop mattress--not some cheap, hard mattress with springs poking you in the back all night and barely any cushioning! Additionally, there's a wardrobe and dresser in the room if you'd like to fully unpack your suitcase and get comfortable.This larger bedroom faces the street, and it gets wonderful natural light during the day. There is some general city noise that can sometimes be heard--after all, you are choosing to stay in Manhattan and not out in the suburbs or countryside--but at night the blackout curtains help to reduce (but not eliminate) the sounds of the city. Some guests may need ear plugs at night while others will not.Fresh, quality bed linens and towels are provided for your stay, as is WiFi. Additionally, there is an iron and hair dryer available for shared use. In the kitchen you'll find a delicious selection of mostly organic teas for your enjoyment. You are absolutely welcome to make use of the kitchen to prepare any meals, if you wish, and you are invited to get comfortable in the living room area and read a book or watch television. In the bedroom you will find a power strip that has four USB ports to charge your electronics and two electrical outlets with international adapters built in to accommodate most all various worldwide electrical plugs. Who's got you covered? I do!My apartment is a fairly typical NYC flat--not huge but very welcoming, warm, safe and clean (earth-friendly, cruelty-free products are used). Typical smaller, older, downtown apartment buildings like this one don't have an elevator/lift--but this one does (as of a couple of years ago!) to make transporting your luggage upstairs easy or if you have problems with stairs.Your host--that would be me--is a genuinely kind, friendly, former Midwesterner who wants to make sure your visit to this fabulous city is wonderful (I hope you love it as much as I do!) and that your stay in my home is as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. In short, while you are visiting, my home is your home.Please notice that I'm not just a host--I'm a Superhost. That means that I've earned the Superhost badge from Airbnb (added by Airbnb to my profile) and go above and beyond Airbnb's standards of quality that is required from hosts, doing what I can to ensure your stay is more-than-comfortable and helping to make it a 5-star experience.Situated on East 10th Street, the location is convenient to all that this city has to offer. The L train is a less-than-5-minute walk away, and Tompkins Square Park is right around the corner. Within a short walking distance is Union Square, Greenwich Village, the Lower East Side, Chinatown, SoHo, Washington Square Park and more! Subway trains that are very close include the L, 4, 5, 6, F, N, R, Q, all of which will connect you wherever you want to go in a snap!For your convenience, the neighborhood offers plenty of restaurants (including vegetarian/vegan, Thai, Japanese, Mexican, pizza, falafels, diners and much more), grocery stores (including Whole Foods and Trader Joe's), farmer's markets, coffee shops, 24-hour delis and pharmacies, off-Broadway theatres, cinemas, nightlife options and more.Guest accessThis is the larger of TWO guest rooms in this apartment. Your bedroom will be private, but YOU WILL BE SHARING THE COMMON AREAS of the apartment--bathroom, kitchen and living room areas.Other things to note1. The room itself is about 9.5'x14' (about 135 sq. feet/12.5 sq meters), and there are two guest rooms in the apartment.2. Your bedroom is private, but YOU WILL BE SHARING THE COMMON AREAS of the apartment (bathroom, kitchen and living room) if there is another guest in the other guest room for the same time period. If this is an issue for you, then do not book this room.3. If I am not traveling, then I personally tidy up my place every day or every other one to clean the common areas and to make sure things are stocked (teas, hand soap, paper towels, toilet tissue, etc.) and garbage and recyclables are removed. I do ask that you help me keep the place clean by picking up after yourself and disposing of trash and recyclables in their proper places.The place is super-convenient as noted above, has an awesome host (if I may say so myself) and is a great value.I enjoy meeting different people, and I look forward to welcoming you as a guest into my home./ Please DO NOT SUBMIT A BOOKING REQUEST WITHOUT CONTACTING ME FIRST.

""Life isn't about finding yourself, life is about creating yourself."" ""Carpe Diem."" ""If we wait until we're ready, we'll be waiting for the rest of our lives.""

Let it all come ripping right through you.""- Jeff Bridges. ""There is no time like the present."" *Will be updating as we keep evolving in NYC and from every single guest that adds something new to our lives:D COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS: 1. Is your neighborhood safe? Most definitely. The entire city of Manhattan is continually being remodeled and improved for the community. 2. How do you pay security deposit? Security deposit is NEVER paid UNLESS something in the apartment is broken:) 3. Is the apartment shared? Only with us your hosts:). 4. Can I invite guests over? You MUST notify us before inviting any guests. However, if the guest is not registered they CANNOT sleep overnight in the apartment. 5. Are your dogs friendly? Our dogs are friendly but do bark in enthusiasm when they meet new guests. If you are not comfortable with enthusiastic dogs we would recommend you look for another accommodation. 6. What type of room is it? It is a CONVERTED private living room. This means that the living room has been fitted with a wooden partition that turns and acts like a door giving complete privacy. This is also why the room has so much space. 7. Why do you not want us to say you are Airbnb guests? Airbnb is a great platform but with any platform, there are always some people that give it a bad reputation with their bad behavior. Because of situations that have occurred in the past with other hosts around the world and then the negative portrayal of such events in the media, they paint the wrong picture for all guests, which is false because most guests are excellent. The words ""Airbnb guests"" carry a negative connotation with some people. We have never had an issue in the 4 YEARS we have been hosting. To avoid making our neighbors feel uneasy we simply avoid it because we know that all our guests are positively reviewed with multiple I.D. verifications:)/ Greetings my fellow compadres and welcome to our profile!

Go to a hotel or try Airbnb Plus.If you don’t like the idea of sharing an apartment with other guests, this isn’t for you (you do get your own room).If you’re creepy, aggressive, or overly anxious, this isn’t for you. If you have a problem with people who smoke weed, This isn’t for you If you’re uncomfortable living in an area with more black people than usual, this isn’t for you (we can assure you it’s safe). If you must have a lock on the outside of the door with your own key, or have a million questions about safety, or need a safe, this isn't for you. I can tell you that all the apartments in NY do not give you a key to your own bedroom. Go to a hotel, that's where your door will lock with a key. We've never had any issues with theft and we know everyone.If you’re booking us for a romantic getaway with your partner, this probably isn’t for you unless you’re both on the same page about this space (meaning that you don’t get the whole apartment to yourself, just the room). If you’re gonna give us a bad review because the L train took too long on the weekend, this isn’t for you.We clean the bathroom a few times a week and we ask that our guests keep it clean as well. We try hard to keep it clean but we don’t have the budget to clean it multiple times a day. There’s a chance that in between cleanings, the bathroom gets slightly dirty (but still much cleaner than most shared bathrooms).  If you’re gonna leave us a bad review because the bathroom isn’t perfectly clean 24/7, this place isn’t for you.NO OVERNIGHT GUESTS ALLOWED–If you did not book for an additional guest, you may not sneak in a guest to stay over. While it's okay if you happen to have sex spontaneously, please note that this is not a sex hotel—don't come here for the sole purpose of having sex./ We are a lodge in Bushwick for creative and fun people. Please keep expectations low—you get a real mattress on top of slates but without a bed frame in a basement you share with 2 other guests, clean sheets, a blanket, wifi, heat, and other essentials.

We can also point you to nearby spots for bicycle rental, and you can take advantage of Citi-Bike, New York City's bicycle-sharing program with locations nearby our house.LaundryThere are ""all-in-one"" washer-dryers here. . They're very high end machines, but cannot dry at very high heat, so they're best for small loads, and/or we can provide you with drying racks.For a nominal charge, we can also offer you laundry service (sorry, no folding)  using the professional machines we use for guest linens and towels.  And of course we can direct you to trusted dry-cleaners or a laundry mat just two blocks away if you've been on a long journey and need to catch up on a couple week's of cleaning.BathroomsOur four bathrooms, all available to guests, have excellent hot water, great water pressure and high quality toiletries (shampoos, soaps, body rinse, toothpaste,  mouthwash, hair dryers, and more). If you forget something (razor, toothbrush, comb, etc, just ask).  Please do not leave your own toiletries or wet towels in the shared bathrooms; all the guest rooms have plenty of space for them. For sanitary reasons we do not want guests to accidentally share towels, so guest towels found in the bathrooms when we clean are removed and laundered.   Of course sometimes guests accidentally leave towels.  No problem, just ask us for fresh replacements.Other things to noteAbout Brooklyn&BreakfastOur home, with four fully-hosted airbnb apartments,  and several hosts working as a team  is a unique arrangement: a true  cooperative of airbnb hosts pooling resources for the benefit of our guests and for the community.I own the building, an 1893 Brooklyn Brownstone and live in the garden apartment.  Andy and her partner Michael live and host on the 2nd floor.  Patricia, a retiree,  and Brandon, a teacher, share the 3rd floor with two guest rooms.  Ed, a contractor, plus his daughter, in grammar school,  are our fourth floor tenants, co-hosts, and friends. We all work together as a team.We share many responsibilities, and provide services we could never offer to guests as individuals, yet each apartment here has its own character:-My  garden apartment is the Brooklyn&Breakfast hub.  It's where we cook and serve breakfast for all our hosts' guests every morning, w/ choices for everyone from paleo-carnivore to vegan.  This  includes a leisurely Sunday Brunch with many homemade choices and a chance to meet fascinating guests from around the world.The apartment has three lovely guest rooms plus common areas, with garden/backyard access during the warm months.  I live in the finished side of the lower (English Basement) level of the duplex; the other side is  where we do  laundry, keep supplies, and provide extra storage for some of our guests.  There is also a 12-month indoor-garden for fresh herbs & micro-greens year round.-Andy and her partner Mike's 2nd floor apartment with two guest rooms and giant comfortable common spaces is a great place to spend time.  It's recently renovated and stylishly decorated. Andy, who works in urban planning and is also a part-time student  is often around very much enjoys getting to know our guests.  Mike is equally hospitable,  but he works long hours and you won't run into him quite as often-Our cohosts Pat and Brandon are roommates sharing the third floor.  Pat, a retiree who used to manage bed&breakfasts professionally, and Brandon, a special needs school teacher, will also make everyone feel welcome in their comfortable living room, dining room and well-equipped kitchen.-Ed  and his grade-school aged daughter Autumn are the 4th floor hosts.  Ed, an old friend, has been an airbnb host in different homes for several years.  He's a contractor and a big part of his contribution is making slow-but-steady building improvements, from  better soundproofing guest-rooms, to repainting the hallways, and lots more.  Ed works long hours but he really enjoys meeting and entertaining our guests.DIY  laundry and/or laundry service and lots of extras are available to guests all four apartments.Brooklyn&Breakfast is mostly a labor of love, and it's also a little bit of a social statement:We aim to demonstrate an alternative model for home sharing that can provide guests with a level of services closer to (and often surpassing) a true B&B or hotel, albeit with a more relaxed,  'mi casa es tu casa' flavor.A stay at Brooklyn&Breakfast is not like renting a spare room or someone else's empty home while they're away, but neither is it anything like the  growing number of dubiously-legal aibnb quasi-hotels. By keeping rents affordable for long-term tenants, and taking pride in our neighborhood and in Brooklyn, we believe we're a small force against too-rapid gentrification.If you have any questions, please contact us by sending us a message.ParkingLike most of New York City, Prospect Heights offers street parking, and we can also direct you to local parking lots. Paid parking in prime Brownstone Brooklyn is pricy compared to many cities but a bargain compared to Manhattan./ Master bedroom with queen bed, mini-fridge & microwave, guests welcomed 24/7.

We started in 2015, and we’ve had a blast and hosted over 3,500 visits. But Covid-19 has changed everything for now, so we have evolved as well. This Team Profile is just one click from each of our house’s listings. We’re updating it regularly with the latest information, procedures, and rules to best keep ourselves and our guests safe! We’ve been operating Brooklyn&Breakfast for just shy of five years, and we spent mid-March to mid-May 2020 completely reinventing nearly everything we do here to adjust to the new reality of life with Covid-19. Going forward, and for *at least* the balance of 2020, our primary focus is health and safety, cleanliness, and of course, continuous disinfecting with our house-cleaner/manager Jeanine, our team of hosts, and also each guest doing their part. Basic Rules - All guests checking into Brooklyn&Breakfast must have been “sheltering at home” and/or observing hand-washing/sanitizing, social distancing, and face-covering protocols comparable to New York City’s guidelines for no less than two weeks prior to checking-in. Additionally Guests must be free of recognized Covid-19 Presenting Symptoms as per the U.S. Center for Disease Control's guidelines (easy to find online...airbnb won't let us put a link here) and/or be prepared to show documentation of having received negative test results for Covid-19 dated no more than 48 hours before arrival. - Hand-washing and/or application of hand sanitizer is required when returning to the house, plus both before and after cooking or eating, and at additional times as needed. - Social Distancing: whenever possible guests and residents agree to do their best to maintain six feet of distance between one another. To make it easier we’ve removed some seatings and posted some signs, but it’s each guest’s responsibility to comply - Face Coverings/Masks : Except when eating, guests are expected to treat our shared spaces like public spaces in New York City: if you cannot maintain six feet of distance, you MUST wear a face-covering. - Bathrooms and Kitchens: our program of continuous disinfecting relies on everyone pitching in. When new guests arrive we’ll show you our system for the bathrooms. If you’re cooking or using any of the four kitchens here, you’re expected to wear the provided nitrile gloves, and to thoroughly clean all cookware, utensils and surfaces (including all counters and stovetops) with soap. - When serving themselves breakfast, coffee, tea, snacks, etc. guests must use the provided disposable thin-plastic food service gloves, like the ones typically seen in use on the *other* side of the counter at deli counters and fast-food restaurants To minimize the number of new people in and out of the building, our focus for at least the next few months will be on guest stays of one month or longer with rare exceptions for regular guests we already consider close friends, and a handful of experienced airbnb community members with impeccable recommendations as conscientious and who are already “sheltering at home” and/or otherwise taking all the same precautions as us, including numerous measures above and beyond New York City’s rules and guidelines (e.g. masks in public, social distancing, careful monitoring and getting tested if you notice *any* known Covid-19 symptoms). In March we cut the number of guest rooms by over a third, and lowered occupancy for the building even more with new guidance for who can share a room. Disinfecting We were already a bit germaphobic long before anyone heard of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, so meeting airbnb’s guidance for cleaning rooms between guest stays, and disinfecting common areas is no problem for us (read airbnb’s standards here: https://www.airbnb.com/resources/hosting-homes/a/cleaning-guidelines-to-help-prevent-the-spread-of-covid-19-163 .) Often-touched surfaces like light switches, door knobs, appliances, tables and chairs, sofas, railings and banisters are now fully disinfected at least twice daily, and more often as needed. To make sure that shared bathrooms stay clean and safe we designed and tested a thorough system combining three elements: daily professional “deep” cleaning and disinfecting; a second daily cleaning/sanitizing regimen for each apartment’s temants/host; plus an easy disinfecting wiped-down each time anyone, guest or resident, uses a bathroom. This quick step combines one-time-only use machine-washable microfiber hand towels with a bleach-based disinfectant spray to let users wipe down of all surfaces, switches, door knobs, fixtures, etc. they touched Our hosts will show newly arrived guests how it works (and how easy it is) in just one-to-two minutes. Breakfast and Meals Breakfast has always been, and remains a top priority for Brooklyn&Breakfast guests, especially for our visitors who are on a tight budget. But we’ve made some important adjustments to reflect increased emphasis on social distance and safety for ourselves and for our guests. -We’ve put away the silverware. Until further notice, everyone uses one-time-use plastic-wrapped kits with forks, knives, spoons and napkins. -Condiments including peanut butter, cream cheese, butter, jam, honey, etc are also in single-serving containers -All food, from cereals like Cheerios and Corn Flakes, to homemade choices like quiche, home fries and salad/greens, will be presented as prepared single servings. -As always, our food prep is done with medical-grade nitrile gloves. But additionally, now guests and residents alike must use disposable food service gloves, like the ones typically seen on the other side of the counter at deli/fast-food restaurants to serve themselves. These are provided right where you need them, and required any time time guests serve themselves, even if you are just grabbing a quick snack or refilling a cup of coffee or tea. -About half the seating is removed to comply with social distancing, and when weather permits, we’ll encourage guest to eat ‘Al Fresco’ in the backyard. Because of reduced seating, and depending on the total number of guests staying, and their plans, we may ask some guests to adjust when they’re sitting down for breakfast by 15-30 minutes to accommodate social distancing and allow for cleaning/disinfecting between guests. -There will be no interruption to our commitment to accommodate any/every diet, from vegan to paleo-carnivore, from low-carb or gluten free, to low fat and many more guests probably think we've never heard of. However, a little bit more in-advance planning may be required. -With fewer rooms and fewer guests, 100% fully-hosted breakfasts and breakfast cooking to-order may be shortened or even eliminated depending on occupancy and guest schedules. However, we have increased the availability and variety of choices, and breakfast, like snacks, coffee and tea previously, is now available to everyone 24/7. More questions?

Being students we can get pretty busy with schoolwork and labor but we are always accessible to guests. As long as you bring positivity, happiness, and open-mindedness you will fit right in with our hosting ways!haha Life Mottos: ""We are all one."" ""Work hard, play hard."" ""Life isn't about finding yourself, life is about creating yourself."" ""Carpe Diem."" ""If we wait until we're ready, we'll be waiting for the rest of our lives."" ""The fight is won or lost far away from witnesses - behind the lines, in the gym, and out there on the road, long before I dance under those lights. ~ Muhammad Ali ""We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then, is not an act, but a habit."" ~ Aristotle ""We're here for such a short period of time. Live like your already dead man. Have a good time. Do your best. Let it all come ripping right through you.""- Jeff Bridges. ""There is no time like the present."" *Will be updating as we keep evolving in NYC and from every single guest that adds something new to our lives:D COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS: 1. Is your neighborhood safe? Most definitely. The entire city of Manhattan is continually being remodeled and improved for the community. 2. How do you pay security deposit? Security deposit is NEVER paid UNLESS something in the apartment is broken:) 3. Is the apartment shared? Only with us your hosts:). 4. Can I invite guests over? You MUST notify us before inviting any guests. However, if the guest is not registered they CANNOT sleep overnight in the apartment. 5. Are your dogs friendly? Our dogs are friendly but do bark in enthusiasm when they meet new guests. If you are not comfortable with enthusiastic dogs we would recommend you look for another accommodation. 6. What type of room is it? It is a CONVERTED private living room. This means that the living room has been fitted with a wooden partition that turns and acts like a door giving complete privacy. This is also why the room has so much space. 7. Why do you not want us to say you are Airbnb guests? Airbnb is a great platform but with any platform, there are always some people that give it a bad reputation with their bad behavior. Because of situations that have occurred in the past with other hosts around the world and then the negative portrayal of such events in the media, they paint the wrong picture for all guests, which is false because most guests are excellent. The words ""Airbnb guests"" carry a negative connotation with some people. We have never had an issue in the 4 YEARS we have been hosting. To avoid making our neighbors feel uneasy we simply avoid it because we know that all our guests are positively reviewed with multiple I.D. verifications:)/ Greetings my fellow compadres and welcome to our profile!

Also, if you need to arrive late there is a way to leave you a key, please ask me and I will explain.Q: If something goes wrong (with the plumbing, electrical or whatever) who do we call? Will we be left someone's contact info?A: Call me, I have a plumber and carpenter on call. there is a sticker with plumber number on the boilers and water heaters in real emergency. the restaurant on the first floor helps you out.Q: Will you be stopping by the place during our stay? (Some people have read reviews about owners showing up without notice)A: No.Q: Is there anything we should be aware of? Maintenance issues, noises, weird neighbors....A: Just don’t buzz all apts at 2am. Don't write me a message if you really don't want to book just to see if I reply, I get tons of messages and I reply to every one of them.

Need fresh towels? Just ask.Other things to noteAbout Brooklyn&BreakfastOur home, with four fully-hosted airbnb apartments,  and several hosts working as a team  is a unique arrangement: a cooperative of airbnb hosts pooling resources for the benefit of our guests and for the community.I own the building, an 1893 Brooklyn Brownstone and live in the garden apartment.  Andrew, a gourmet chef lives and host on the 2nd floor.   Brandon, a public teacher is the main host on the the 3rd floor. Ed, a contractor, plus his daughter, in grammar school,  are our fourth floor tenants, co-hosts, and friends. We all work together as a team.We share many responsibilities, and provide services we could never offer to guests as individuals, yet each apartment here has its own character.Brooklyn&Breakfast is mostly a labor of love, and it's also a little bit of a social statement:We aim to demonstrate an alternative model for home sharing that can provide guests with a level of services closer to (and often surpassing) a true B&B or hotel, but with a more relaxed,  'mi casa es tu casa' flavor and incorporating time-saving services like scheduled grocery deliveries to make your visit here easy.A stay at Brooklyn&Breakfast is not like renting a spare room or someone else's empty home while they're away, but neither is it anything like the  growing number of dubiously-legal airbnb quasi-hotels. By keeping rents affordable for long-term tenants, and taking pride in our neighborhood and in Brooklyn, we believe we're a small force against too-rapid gentrification.If you have any questions, please contact us by sending us a message.ParkingLike most of New York City, Prospect Heights offers street parking, and we can also direct you to local parking lots.

We started in 2015, and we’ve had a blast and hosted over 3,500 visits. But Covid-19 has changed everything for now, so we have evolved as well. This Team Profile is just one click from each of our house’s listings. We’re updating it regularly with the latest information, procedures, and rules to best keep ourselves and our guests safe! We’ve been operating Brooklyn&Breakfast for just shy of five years, and we spent mid-March to mid-May 2020 completely reinventing nearly everything we do here to adjust to the new reality of life with Covid-19. Going forward, and for *at least* the balance of 2020, our primary focus is health and safety, cleanliness, and of course, continuous disinfecting with our house-cleaner/manager Jeanine, our team of hosts, and also each guest doing their part. Basic Rules - All guests checking into Brooklyn&Breakfast must have been “sheltering at home” and/or observing hand-washing/sanitizing, social distancing, and face-covering protocols comparable to New York City’s guidelines for no less than two weeks prior to checking-in. Additionally Guests must be free of recognized Covid-19 Presenting Symptoms as per the U.S. Center for Disease Control's guidelines (easy to find online...airbnb won't let us put a link here) and/or be prepared to show documentation of having received negative test results for Covid-19 dated no more than 48 hours before arrival. - Hand-washing and/or application of hand sanitizer is required when returning to the house, plus both before and after cooking or eating, and at additional times as needed. - Social Distancing: whenever possible guests and residents agree to do their best to maintain six feet of distance between one another. To make it easier we’ve removed some seatings and posted some signs, but it’s each guest’s responsibility to comply - Face Coverings/Masks : Except when eating, guests are expected to treat our shared spaces like public spaces in New York City: if you cannot maintain six feet of distance, you MUST wear a face-covering. - Bathrooms and Kitchens: our program of continuous disinfecting relies on everyone pitching in. When new guests arrive we’ll show you our system for the bathrooms. If you’re cooking or using any of the four kitchens here, you’re expected to wear the provided nitrile gloves, and to thoroughly clean all cookware, utensils and surfaces (including all counters and stovetops) with soap. - When serving themselves breakfast, coffee, tea, snacks, etc. guests must use the provided disposable thin-plastic food service gloves, like the ones typically seen in use on the *other* side of the counter at deli counters and fast-food restaurants To minimize the number of new people in and out of the building, our focus for at least the next few months will be on guest stays of one month or longer with rare exceptions for regular guests we already consider close friends, and a handful of experienced airbnb community members with impeccable recommendations as conscientious and who are already “sheltering at home” and/or otherwise taking all the same precautions as us, including numerous measures above and beyond New York City’s rules and guidelines (e.g. masks in public, social distancing, careful monitoring and getting tested if you notice *any* known Covid-19 symptoms). In March we cut the number of guest rooms by over a third, and lowered occupancy for the building even more with new guidance for who can share a room. Disinfecting We were already a bit germaphobic long before anyone heard of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, so meeting airbnb’s guidance for cleaning rooms between guest stays, and disinfecting common areas is no problem for us (read airbnb’s standards here: https://www.airbnb.com/resources/hosting-homes/a/cleaning-guidelines-to-help-prevent-the-spread-of-covid-19-163 .) Often-touched surfaces like light switches, door knobs, appliances, tables and chairs, sofas, railings and banisters are now fully disinfected at least twice daily, and more often as needed. To make sure that shared bathrooms stay clean and safe we designed and tested a thorough system combining three elements: daily professional “deep” cleaning and disinfecting; a second daily cleaning/sanitizing regimen for each apartment’s temants/host; plus an easy disinfecting wiped-down each time anyone, guest or resident, uses a bathroom. This quick step combines one-time-only use machine-washable microfiber hand towels with a bleach-based disinfectant spray to let users wipe down of all surfaces, switches, door knobs, fixtures, etc. they touched Our hosts will show newly arrived guests how it works (and how easy it is) in just one-to-two minutes. Breakfast and Meals Breakfast has always been, and remains a top priority for Brooklyn&Breakfast guests, especially for our visitors who are on a tight budget. But we’ve made some important adjustments to reflect increased emphasis on social distance and safety for ourselves and for our guests. -We’ve put away the silverware. Until further notice, everyone uses one-time-use plastic-wrapped kits with forks, knives, spoons and napkins. -Condiments including peanut butter, cream cheese, butter, jam, honey, etc are also in single-serving containers -All food, from cereals like Cheerios and Corn Flakes, to homemade choices like quiche, home fries and salad/greens, will be presented as prepared single servings. -As always, our food prep is done with medical-grade nitrile gloves. But additionally, now guests and residents alike must use disposable food service gloves, like the ones typically seen on the other side of the counter at deli/fast-food restaurants to serve themselves. These are provided right where you need them, and required any time time guests serve themselves, even if you are just grabbing a quick snack or refilling a cup of coffee or tea. -About half the seating is removed to comply with social distancing, and when weather permits, we’ll encourage guest to eat ‘Al Fresco’ in the backyard. Because of reduced seating, and depending on the total number of guests staying, and their plans, we may ask some guests to adjust when they’re sitting down for breakfast by 15-30 minutes to accommodate social distancing and allow for cleaning/disinfecting between guests. -There will be no interruption to our commitment to accommodate any/every diet, from vegan to paleo-carnivore, from low-carb or gluten free, to low fat and many more guests probably think we've never heard of. However, a little bit more in-advance planning may be required. -With fewer rooms and fewer guests, 100% fully-hosted breakfasts and breakfast cooking to-order may be shortened or even eliminated depending on occupancy and guest schedules. However, we have increased the availability and variety of choices, and breakfast, like snacks, coffee and tea previously, is now available to everyone 24/7. More questions?

Sausages, beer & other Austrian-Hungarian favorites served at communal tables indoors & out. 1422 Grand St, Hoboken, NJ 0703•Getting aroundThere are several ways to get to New York City from the apartment but the most convenient are by bus.To Midtown ManhattanThe easiest way to Manhattan is by NJ Transit. There are two lines: Rt. 123 and 119. The bus stop for rt. 123 is directly outside the house at Palisade and South. The stop for route 119 is at Congress and Palisade Ave. You can wait at that corner and get whichever bus comes first. BUT, be aware the stop for route 119 is across the street on Palisade at Congress, while the 123 stop is on our side of Palisade. So you need to keep your eyes out and be ready to cross the street quickly if you do this!*When taking the NJ transit bus back from Port Authority, you need to buy tickets before boarding the bus.The fare is $4.50, and you must have exact change. (Budget tip: if you take the route 119 and get on at the next stop at Paterson Plank Road at Congress the fare is only $3.50).There is an apps called Citymapper that can make the process a lot easier. Enter where you’re going and it tells you the best route and the times of the next bus.There are also a series of jitney’s that run on the same line. They cost only $2 but they’re often full and only run during rush hour.To Downtown NYC Two main ways to get to downtown Manhattan are: 1: Take the 87 Bus on Palisade ave. to EITHER the Journal Square PATH station or Hoboken PATH station.Via Journal Square: To go to Journal Square this you will go outside, cross Palisade avenue, and wait at the bus stop across the street (by the Tortilla place). You’ll need $1.50. The Journal Square stop should be announced, you’ll only be on the bus for a few minutes. At Journal Square, look for signs for the PATH train. You’ll need to buy either a PATH card or Metrocard. Metrocard might be preferable as you can use it on the NYC subways as well. The fare is $2.50. Find a machine and buy a credit card, adding as much value as you think you’ll need. You can take the PATH to either World Trade Center (to go to the lower tip of Manhattan) or the 33rd street line which has stops through downtown New York around 6th Avenue.Via Hoboken: You catch the 87 bus right outside our door on our side of the street. Get off at Hoboken which should be the final stop. The PATH station is right where the busses get off. Same PATH instructions as above.2: Or if you prefer, you can take the light rail. This will take a bit longer, but might be a nicer trip, particularly if you want to walk around Hoboken, which is a nice town. You take a right outside the apartment, walk to Congress, and take a right. At the end of Congress you should see a large elevator structure. Take the elevator down and you’ll be at the light rail station. Take a light rail train to Hoboken (should say HBLR Hoboken). Hoboken will be the last stop. You then take a PATH train, either to World Trade Center to go far downtown, or the 33rd street train which has stops through downtown New York. Another route by light rail is to take the train to Newport instead of Hoboken. From the 9th street station you’ll look for a train that says HBLR West Side). Take that to Newport stop. When you get there you will need to walk one block across Washington Ave (a large road) to the Newport PATH Station. This will take you on the 33rd street line.To Hoboken Jersey City Heights is just steps to Hoboken down a very steep hill. There are two ways to get there. One is to take a right outside the apartment, walk to Congress, and take a right. At the end of Congress you should see a large elevator structure. Take the elevator down and you’ll be at the light rail station in Hoboken. You can take the light rail two stops to get to the heart of Hoboken. The main drag is called Washington street.The other is to take a left outside the apartment, turn left at Franklin Street, and take the large stairway down. If you walk straight ahead you’ll be on 1st street. If you go straight on 1st you’ll end up in the heart of Hoboken.ParkingStreet parking is limited to two hours during the day and free after 5 pm during weekday. Weekend is free. You need a permit to park on our streets for any longer than 2 hours between 8am-5pm during the week. Short term permits can be purchased for $5 a day at the Jersey City Parking Authority, at 394 Central Ave. just a few blocks from the houseIf you plan to use the car during the day you might not need a pass. You scratch off only the day you're using it and display that on your car. IMPORTANT POINT: keep in mind that even if you have a pass, you need to make sure to park in a valid spot. There are street cleanings periodically where certain spots become no parking zones for a set amount of time twice a week. Check the signs closely (even if you don't see one right near the car).

It shares borders with Hunters Point and Long Island City to the west, Astoria to the north, Woodside to the east and Maspeth to the south The name ""Sunnyside"" originates with the Bragaw family, French Huguenots who had purchased the land in 1713 and named their estate ""Sunnyside Hill"". Sunnyside was a rural hamlet mostly consisting of small farms and marshland.Sunnyside is the unrecognized star of western Queens. A small, middle-class neighborhood, rich with access to transportation and interesting restaurants, Sunnyside has an urban look with many six-story buildings. One section, Sunnyside Gardens, has a more suburban feel. The neighborhood's zip code is 11104.Very close to Manhattan and the Empire State Building, Sunnyside is 15 minutes from Midtown by the #7 subway. It rides high above multi-lane Queens Boulevard, which splits the neighborhood in half.​Neighborhood Boundaries and Main StreetsTo Sunnyside's south, the Long Island Expressway is the border with Blissville. To the west, the huge Sunnyside Rail Yards separate the neighborhood from Long Island City and Astoria.To the east there's New Cavalry Cemetery and, roughly along 50th Avenue, Woodside, which is more a partner than a neighbor.Main streets are roaring Queens Boulevard, bustling shopping on Greenpoint Avenue, and quieter commercial strips on 43rd and Skillman Avenues. Industry takes over west of 39th Street.Sunnyside GardensA planned community, Sunnyside Gardens started in 1924, its builders inspired by the English garden city movement. The Gardens is a mix of attached single-family, two-family, and three-family homes and one co-op, along tree-lined streets, north of Queens Boulevard.On several of Sunnyside Gardens's seven-plus blocks, homes share a common interior garden. Residents also share a private park. The Sunnyside Gardens Preservation Alliance is dedicated to the preservation, history, and liveability of the Sunnyside Gardens National Register Historic District.Sunnyside Real Estate and ApartmentsAccording to Neighborhood Scout, the Sunnyside median real estate price is $911,930, which is more expensive than 87.1 percent of the neighborhoods in New York and 95.9 percent of the neighborhoods in the U.S.The average rental price in Sunnyside is currently $1,913, based on Neighborhood Scout's analysis. Rents are currently lower in price than 45.7 percent of New York neighborhoods.Sunnyside housing consists of small (studio to two bedrooms) to medium sized (three or four bedrooms) apartment buildings and high-rise apartments, with many being historic buildings.HistoryThe name ""Sunnyside"" originates from the time of the Bragaw family, French Huguenots who purchased the land in 1713 and named their holdings ""Sunnyside Hill.""Sunnyside was farmland until the early 1900s when the Queensboro Bridge was built and the improved access turned farmers into land sellers. Sunnyside Gardens got its start in 1924 and has always attracted creative types like actors and writers. Many of the larger buildings in the area went up in the 1930s.Once strongly Irish, Sunnyside in the last 40 years has welcomed South Americans, Koreans, Turks, Romanians, and new Irish immigrants. The local St. Pat's for All Parade, with a focus on valuing diversity, has brought media attention to the area.Restaurants and PubsQueens Boulevard, Greenpoint Avenue, and Skillman Avenue are the streets for eats with lots of local ethnic favorites.Saffron Garden is an Indian restaurant on Skillman Avenue offering vegan dishes, traditional curries, and tandoori specialties.Arriba Arriba on Queens Boulevard attracts a young crowd and serves up Mexican food paired with margaritas.Vera Thai, also on Queens Boulevard, has Thai food with a mix-and-match curry selection.Tangra Fusion on Queens Boulevard fuses Chinese and Indian cuisine a well as traditional Chinese fare in an elegant setting.Find a great selection of brews and pub grub on pub row (Queens Boulevard, 41st to 48th Streets), starting, even staying, at Gaslight (4317 Queens Boulevard) and its backyard garden. Rock out Latin style at La Kueva (39-31 Queens Boulevard).Parks and Green SpacesSunnyside lacks a landscaped public park. The Thomas P. Noonan Playground (Greenpoint and 47th Avenues, 43rd Street) with its rainbow fountain and Lou Ladati Playground (Skillman Avenue and 43rd Street) are fine for jungle gyms and basketball courts.The private Sunnyside Park (39th Avenue and 49th Street) is a delicious slice of three green acres. Dues-paying Sunnyside Gardens residents also contribute their labor to keep it so nice.Things To DoSunnyside is an has an artistic, eclectic vibe. Pubs, thrift store shopping, and art are on the list of things to do in the neighborhood.Thalia Spanish Theatre (4117 Greenpoint Avenue) energizes with quality, original musicals. It's considered a home for Spanish culture.The art collective Flux Factory (3838 43rd Street) has the most fun art events in Queens at their warehouse home.Crime and SafetySunnyside is quite safe. As always, be aware of your surroundings, especially at night. It's a bad idea to walk alone in the industrial areas in the dark. Ironically, for being the home of so many taxi companies, it's impossible to get a taxi. The 108th Precinct (including Long Island City) reports indicate a reduction in crime over time.Neighborhood Basics and ServicesConcerns about the neighborhood include lack of parking, traffic congestion, and school overcrowding while the positives are safety, diversity and the historic Sunnyside Gardens complex. Neighborhood resources and services include:Public Library: 43-06 Greenpoint AvenueSchools: In the 11104 zip code, there are two public elementary schools: P.S. 150 and P.S. 199 Maurice A. Fitzgerald School.Transportation: Subways: 7 (local) - 46th Street/Bliss, 40th Street/Lowery Street and the Long Island Railroad (LIRR)—in nearby Woodside at Roosevelt and 61st Avenue.Parking: South of and along Queens Boulevard is tight.

Need fresh ones? Just ask.Other things to noteAbout Brooklyn&BreakfastOur home, with four fully-hosted airbnb apartments,  and several hosts working as a team  is a unique arrangement: a cooperative of airbnb hosts pooling resources for the benefit of our guests and for the community.I own the building, an 1893 Brooklyn Brownstone and live in the garden apartment.  Andrew, a gourmet chef lives and host on the 2nd floor.   Brandon, a public teacher is the main host on the the 3rd floor. Ed, a contractor, plus his daughter, in grammar school,  are our fourth floor tenants, co-hosts, and friends. We all work together as a team.We share many responsibilities, and provide services we could never offer to guests as individuals, yet each apartment here has its own character:Brooklyn&Breakfast is mostly a labor of love, and it's also a little bit of a social statement:We aim to demonstrate an alternative model for home sharing that can provide guests with a level of services closer to (and often surpassing) a true B&B or hotel, but with a more relaxed,  'mi casa es tu casa' flavor and incorporating time-saving services like scheduled grocery deliveries to make your visit here easy.A stay at Brooklyn&Breakfast is not like renting a spare room or someone else's empty home while they're away, but neither is it anything like the  growing number of dubiously-legal airbnb quasi-hotels. By keeping rents affordable for long-term tenants, and taking pride in our neighborhood and in Brooklyn, we believe we're a small force against too-rapid gentrification.If you have any questions, please contact us by sending us a message.ParkingLike most of New York City, Prospect Heights offers street parking, and we can also direct you to local parking lots.

We started in 2015, and we’ve had a blast and hosted over 3,500 visits. But Covid-19 has changed everything for now, so we have evolved as well. This Team Profile is just one click from each of our house’s listings. We’re updating it regularly with the latest information, procedures, and rules to best keep ourselves and our guests safe! We’ve been operating Brooklyn&Breakfast for just shy of five years, and we spent mid-March to mid-May 2020 completely reinventing nearly everything we do here to adjust to the new reality of life with Covid-19. Going forward, and for *at least* the balance of 2020, our primary focus is health and safety, cleanliness, and of course, continuous disinfecting with our house-cleaner/manager Jeanine, our team of hosts, and also each guest doing their part. Basic Rules - All guests checking into Brooklyn&Breakfast must have been “sheltering at home” and/or observing hand-washing/sanitizing, social distancing, and face-covering protocols comparable to New York City’s guidelines for no less than two weeks prior to checking-in. Additionally Guests must be free of recognized Covid-19 Presenting Symptoms as per the U.S. Center for Disease Control's guidelines (easy to find online...airbnb won't let us put a link here) and/or be prepared to show documentation of having received negative test results for Covid-19 dated no more than 48 hours before arrival. - Hand-washing and/or application of hand sanitizer is required when returning to the house, plus both before and after cooking or eating, and at additional times as needed. - Social Distancing: whenever possible guests and residents agree to do their best to maintain six feet of distance between one another. To make it easier we’ve removed some seatings and posted some signs, but it’s each guest’s responsibility to comply - Face Coverings/Masks : Except when eating, guests are expected to treat our shared spaces like public spaces in New York City: if you cannot maintain six feet of distance, you MUST wear a face-covering. - Bathrooms and Kitchens: our program of continuous disinfecting relies on everyone pitching in. When new guests arrive we’ll show you our system for the bathrooms. If you’re cooking or using any of the four kitchens here, you’re expected to wear the provided nitrile gloves, and to thoroughly clean all cookware, utensils and surfaces (including all counters and stovetops) with soap. - When serving themselves breakfast, coffee, tea, snacks, etc. guests must use the provided disposable thin-plastic food service gloves, like the ones typically seen in use on the *other* side of the counter at deli counters and fast-food restaurants To minimize the number of new people in and out of the building, our focus for at least the next few months will be on guest stays of one month or longer with rare exceptions for regular guests we already consider close friends, and a handful of experienced airbnb community members with impeccable recommendations as conscientious and who are already “sheltering at home” and/or otherwise taking all the same precautions as us, including numerous measures above and beyond New York City’s rules and guidelines (e.g. masks in public, social distancing, careful monitoring and getting tested if you notice *any* known Covid-19 symptoms). In March we cut the number of guest rooms by over a third, and lowered occupancy for the building even more with new guidance for who can share a room. Disinfecting We were already a bit germaphobic long before anyone heard of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, so meeting airbnb’s guidance for cleaning rooms between guest stays, and disinfecting common areas is no problem for us (read airbnb’s standards here: https://www.airbnb.com/resources/hosting-homes/a/cleaning-guidelines-to-help-prevent-the-spread-of-covid-19-163 .) Often-touched surfaces like light switches, door knobs, appliances, tables and chairs, sofas, railings and banisters are now fully disinfected at least twice daily, and more often as needed. To make sure that shared bathrooms stay clean and safe we designed and tested a thorough system combining three elements: daily professional “deep” cleaning and disinfecting; a second daily cleaning/sanitizing regimen for each apartment’s temants/host; plus an easy disinfecting wiped-down each time anyone, guest or resident, uses a bathroom. This quick step combines one-time-only use machine-washable microfiber hand towels with a bleach-based disinfectant spray to let users wipe down of all surfaces, switches, door knobs, fixtures, etc. they touched Our hosts will show newly arrived guests how it works (and how easy it is) in just one-to-two minutes. Breakfast and Meals Breakfast has always been, and remains a top priority for Brooklyn&Breakfast guests, especially for our visitors who are on a tight budget. But we’ve made some important adjustments to reflect increased emphasis on social distance and safety for ourselves and for our guests. -We’ve put away the silverware. Until further notice, everyone uses one-time-use plastic-wrapped kits with forks, knives, spoons and napkins. -Condiments including peanut butter, cream cheese, butter, jam, honey, etc are also in single-serving containers -All food, from cereals like Cheerios and Corn Flakes, to homemade choices like quiche, home fries and salad/greens, will be presented as prepared single servings. -As always, our food prep is done with medical-grade nitrile gloves. But additionally, now guests and residents alike must use disposable food service gloves, like the ones typically seen on the other side of the counter at deli/fast-food restaurants to serve themselves. These are provided right where you need them, and required any time time guests serve themselves, even if you are just grabbing a quick snack or refilling a cup of coffee or tea. -About half the seating is removed to comply with social distancing, and when weather permits, we’ll encourage guest to eat ‘Al Fresco’ in the backyard. Because of reduced seating, and depending on the total number of guests staying, and their plans, we may ask some guests to adjust when they’re sitting down for breakfast by 15-30 minutes to accommodate social distancing and allow for cleaning/disinfecting between guests. -There will be no interruption to our commitment to accommodate any/every diet, from vegan to paleo-carnivore, from low-carb or gluten free, to low fat and many more guests probably think we've never heard of. However, a little bit more in-advance planning may be required. -With fewer rooms and fewer guests, 100% fully-hosted breakfasts and breakfast cooking to-order may be shortened or even eliminated depending on occupancy and guest schedules. However, we have increased the availability and variety of choices, and breakfast, like snacks, coffee and tea previously, is now available to everyone 24/7. More questions?

These activities keep me pretty busy especially in the evenings - if you're interested in checking out a free amateur improv comedy show, please let me know and you'll get to see me perform too. My ideal guest is outgoing, independent, and communicates well via text or e-mail. I also prefer a guest that is positive and flexible. I do my best to provide a very clean, warm environment, but things won't always be perfect. Also, keep in mind, this is NYC, a very expensive place, so depending on where you're from, you might be surprised that the price doesn't get you nearly as far as your hometown and the noise level will be likely on average noisier (this note is mainly for those staying in the NYC location.

We invite you to keep coming and enjoy our safe city thanks not only to our Mayor.The spaceMy place makes all feel at home. My home is not in Manhattan, is less than 4 miles to Port Authority Bus Terminal on 42nd Street and 8th Avenue in Manhattan. Thanks for accepting my friendship. Thanks for accepting my invitation to come to stay in my own home for one or more days. Anyone who is a good person is already accepted just go ahead and book to staybin my own home.The information that follows will help us both.My home IS NOT A HOTEL, is a clean humble home,  AIRBNB is not the owner, airbnb app like other apps help us meet very efficiently ; )My property is a private property and does not belong to the mayor of Union City. Choose Newark airport which is only 15 miles to Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan on 42nd street. My home is just 11 miles from Newark airport. My home is between Newark airport and Manhattan.Uber from Newark aiport to my home is about 20 minutes ($25), yellow taxi is about $45.    To come home and go to Times Square: at Port Authority Bus Terminal buy tickets for Bus Route 123 ($3.50 per person 10 tickets for $30). Take this bus 2 blocks from my home to be back in times square in 15-20 minutes depending on traffic. There are many more bus routes from here to Manhattan.My place and my location are NOT PERFECT for everyone please make sure it is perfect for you before you book it.    NYC is noisy and crowded, Union City is much less. It is safe here. Our buildings are closer, multilevel frame structures, sounds from other apartments, water/heating/Air conditioners can be heard. I dont offer parking. There are parking lots nearby for about  $10 per night. Union City munivipality may give you a fine for parking on the street without residential permit. You are booking one private bedroom only not the whole apartment. There is more than one bedroom. You will see me and other guests in the own apartment. No one will on purpose disturb your privacy. You will have keys of my home to come in and go out anytime.Bedroom includes: 2 twin size beds, clean bed linens, towels (replaced every 3 days if you ask), hair dryer, iron and ironing board plus all essentials,  hot and cold water, 120v electricity, strong wifi, heating October 1rst to May 1rst and air conditioner the rest of the year. The view from the bedroom window is of surrounding buildings. Bathrooms with a privacy lock are next to bedrooms but outside bedrooms in this building. Breakfast and kitchen is not included in your booking but as a courtesy you may use the kitchen and enjoy any food I have, breakfast items, milk, eggs, beverages, bread, spreads, etc. In case of emergency: I will pick you up in my car from places or take you to places in New Jersey that is within 30 minutes from my home and help you if it is safe for you and for me to do so. My name is Marlon Vite and I believe that I am the true meaning of an Ambassador of Union City. I love my city. Good strangers come visit us. I am inviting all good strangers, to keep coming to stay in my own home and city, in my own apartment, as family and friend making my family, my ancestry, my city and myself worthy of your visit, come and spend one day or as long as you can in this respectful friendly home.My home is your home where you, your loved ones and your belongings are protected, respected and cared for as if you were my own family. I own this legal 3 apartment building since 2003, I rent 2 apartments long term to strangers, I am single and live in one if the apartments.I allow my 2 long term stranger tenants to receive guests/family in their apartments and whether their guests give them goods in exchange to stay in their apartments is nobody’s business although any additional guests in my building represents for me extra expenses in my building’s utility bills. I am not renting rooms because this Union City Mayor alone imposed a short term rent (less than 30 days) Prohibition.  I believe there is only one tiny hotel here in Union City which I am not sure is worthy of Union City or you. Your monetary donation to me is no payment for staying in my home and you are not obligated to pay to stay in my own apartment or private home, your agreed donation is voluntary non refundable once you check in and I thank you for it. Your voluntary donation to me keeps me inviting new friends into my own private home. If you were to pay to stay in my home I would have to give your money to Union City municipality and they say they will refund it to you just because the mayor of Union City does not like, nor appreciate good strangers as our UEZ (Urban Enterprise Zone) and I do. To encourage strangers to visit, our UEZ has even reduced the sales tax to 3%. Our historical places will also love your visit, our streets display descriptions of many individuals that came from other places who made Union City proud.    This xenophobic mayor himself also receives I think millions of dollars in voluntary donations from strangers but like Fidel Castro is unconstitutionally imposing on other people’s private homes because he does not know the huge difference of public real estate housing and private real estate properties. His imposed law discriminates on single people who cannot afford a whole apartment, it also shamelessly discriminates on all the protected classes that strangers include and on foreign and domestic nationalities.  If one is neutral to injustice one has chosen the side of the oppressor. Home hosting should never be used  as an instrument for political gains/housing control and economic legal Rico pressures on individuals and their private homes by individuals or corporations like this municipality or by “normal” individuals elected or hired to manage our municipal corporation. Your voluntary monetary donation to me helps me pay my city property taxes (even for public school for children that are not mine etc), my mortgage loan, my house insurance, my water-sewer-hot water-electrical-utility bills, other property maintenance bills.    It helps me pay my son’s college and other personal bills. My annual municipal taxes are about $$11,000.This mayor barred Airbnb when Airbnb just helps us you and I meet like many other social media applications do. The amount posted by Airbnb is your agreed donation which will help me pay all related expenses above and so that I may continue to enjoy receiving super guests in my own home apartment and private property. Mayor Brian Stack's anti airbnb law is ""hostis humani generis"" in Latin or ""enemy of mindkind"" by magnitude or measure. BS own anti airbnb law and any inspector, police wo/man, lawwo/man or municipal employee are indeed taking part of this discrimination and thus they are oppressors for their political gain, vote coercion and, public job retension ........ I never vote for this mayor because he dictates as king on us minority landlords and private homeowners. Stack treats private property as if it was his own or as public property. ....... No respect for private property just like Fidel Castro.Thanks for accepting my invitation to stay in my home and city.Guest accessKitchen and breakfast are not included in your booking however I share our kitchen and food free of charge.

ABOUT TRANSPORTATION: Believe it or NOT – it is possible to be outside of Manhattan and so close to it, yet it's true. Here are some facts about transportation:  1. Apartment is 4 minutes ((2 blocks) from the central bus stop at post office.  2. The jitney bus is very frequent, I rarely wait for it more than 2 to 3 minutes. Most of the time you won't even wait at all. You will get to the bus stop and a bus will be there.  3. Buses are available 24/7 so you can catch them even when you spend the whole evening out.  4. The price of these express buses is $3 on board, and $2.50 if you buy tickets at ticket window #23 at Port Authority Bus Terminal  5. You won't find a timetable or route on the internet for these buses, it's a private bus company that runs many lines in and out of Manhattan 6. City bus #22 runs every 30 minutes into Hoboken, home of the Cake Boss, Birthplace of Frank Sinatra and Baseball (where you can also catch the PATH into Manhattan 33rd Street and/or the World Trade Center) and bus #123 every 15-30 minutes (during commute hours) into Manhattan’s Port Authority (42nd Street & 8th Avenue – Times Square) * Easy city bus access to Jersey Garden Outlet Mall, much closer and as good as Woodbury Commons ABOUT PARKING: Being an urban area, parking is tight. We will provide a visitor pass so you have the same privilege as residence. Please note, that you must not forget to return this pass, otherwise we will need to charge you $25.00. For those who are not familiar with the parking system in the US, you must adhere to the parking rules - ie NO parking in fire zones / handicapped zones; sweep days; parking meters need to be adhered to and if you get a ticket, do not assume that you will not get another one if you don't move your car. private parking is also available at an extra price.Guest accessENTIRE SPACE/ Beautiful one bedroom apt in union city new jersey Brand new fully renovated located just minutes from new York city.

Well-connected to everything Manhattan has to offer—and all five Boroughs. Surrounded by countless bars, restaurants, lounges, nightclubs, boutique shops, and attractions. Perfect for singles and couples, and small groups of up to five looking for affordable, yet chic, accommodations.PLEASE READ ALL OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BEFORE BOOKING.The spaceNOTES FROM THE HOST:*****Apartment is being painted next week. Please excuse the handful of three years-worth of dings--thank you.*****PLEASE READ—MANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS ARE LIKELY ANSWERD.Respectfully, if you are considering booking with Airbnb—and you are doing so with high-end, premier luxury hotel expectations—please do not book this apartment and consider a hotel. However, if you understand the concept of Airbnb, please know that this apartment will have EVERYTHING you will need to enjoy your trip. As you can see from the reviews, virtually every guest has been completely satisfied with their experience and given a 5-star rating—some guests have even been repeat visitors.This apartment is perfect for singles and couples, and they will find it very comfortable and intimate. Moreover, this apartment is also the perfect budget accommodation for small groups of three to five people. PLEASE CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING: Up to two people is PERFECT. Three is GREAT. Four is GOOD. Five is OKAY. More than five is VERY CRAMPED. New York City is a very expensive place when it comes to accommodations, among other things. This is why I have furnished the apartment in such a way to accommodate up to five people easily with a modest amount of room.There is no centralized air conditioning and heating system, which is very common for New York City apartments. Therefore, during the months where it is hot, the apartment is equipped with a window air conditioning unit. Please be advised that, in addition to some common street noise (discussed below), noise will generate from the unit while it is running—it is by no means loud and intolerable, you will just notice it’s on. LOCATION INFORMATION:The building is located near the corner of 47th Street and 9th Avenue.The building is one block from the heart of the THEATER DISTRICT and two blocks from the heart of TIMES SQUARE. This is one of THE MOST WELL-CONNECTED Airbnb’s in New York City. The closest metro stops are the C and E trains (located at 50th and 8th Avenue), and the 1-train (located at 50th and 7th Avenue). If you ride either of the aforementioned trains ONE STOP SOUTH, you will be at the 42ND STREET METRO HUB (access to A, C, E, N, Q, R, 1, 2, 3, 7-trains). If you ride the 1-train OR C-train ONE STOP NORTH, you will be at the COLUMBUS CIRCLE/59TH STREET METRO HUB (access to A, C, B, D, 1-trains).The building is a historic, landmarked townhouse (now converted into a multi-apartment building) in the heart of one of the BUSIEST NEIGHBORHOODS in New York City—Hell’s Kitchen. PLEASE NOTE: You will be subject to common street noise from locals and tourists alike. More often than not, guests have not found this to be a problem (per reviews). However, if you are a light sleeper, I suggest bringing earplugs.You will also be surrounded (and steps away) from countless bars, restaurants, lounges, nightclubs, attractions, and boutique shops—tons of activities in the immediate vicinity. BUILDING/APARTMENT INFORMATION:The apartment is a first-floor unit. It is a sunken townhouse entrance, so the “first floor” is about 3ft. (1m) down. There are two steps at the exterior front of the building that guests must walk up or down depending on whether they are entering or exiting the building. Although irrelevant given the previous, to be clear, guests will not have to walk up or down any staircases and or use an elevator.The apartment is a STUDIO apartment. Specifically, it is a Manhattan/New York City studio apartment, which means that it is smaller than the average studio apartment anywhere else in the United States. However, for the area (and for New York City) it is one of the larger studio apartments you will find. IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW:SLEEPING ARRANGEMENTS: There are four beds total—one queen-sized bed (sleeps two), two twin-sized (sleeps one) day beds, and one twin trundle bed. HOST PROVIDES sheets, pillows, and comforters (and a few extra blankets) for all beds. BATHROOM: Equipped with towels, wash clothes, hair dryer.PLEASE NOTE: Bedding, towels, and other essentials that guests use on their bodies is replaced once a month—everything is essentially brand new.KITCHEN: Equipped with pans, cooking utensils, silverware, dishware, and glassware—the essentials. There are no measuring glasses or measuring spoons. HOST DOES NOT PROVIDE cooking ingredients, spices, or special cooking accommodations. Guests can use anything in the kitchen, including foods and ingredients, left by previous reservations.ELECTRICITY & POWER OUTAGES: As I mentioned, the building is old (over 125 years old). Please DO NOT OVERLOAD THE OUTLETS. If there are too many things plugged in at one time, you will cause the circuit breaker to trip and that will result in a loss of electricity. However, DO NOT PANIC! Let me know immediately and I will get the circuit breaker switch turned back on. Do not spend any time looking for it in the apartment as it is not in the apartment, but somewhere else in the building that neither I nor you can access. I can typically have electricity restored for you in minutes. Again, not everything can be plugged in at the same time. HEATING & FURNACE NOISES: As I mentioned, the building is over 125 years old and is pretty much original, specifically with regard to the pipes. The owners (not me) of the building have done nothing to update the pipes or the furnace (except fix random things). As a result, you may hear banging coming from below—that is the furnace turning on. The building controls the heating pipes (I cannot turn them off or on). However, I do provide a heating tower that you can use if you feel like the apartment is not warm enough. However, if you feel like the apartment is too warm, there is nothing I can do about that as I cannot turn off the heating pipes. I have left the A/C unit in the window so you can turn it on to counter the heat.TELEVISION: Due to the fact that previous reservations have managed to break four televisions, Host no longer equips the apartment with a television.COFFEE/TEA MAKER: I do not provide a coffee/tea maker, but there is a pot for heating water and pouring into instant coffee or for tea packets. I do not believe the plastic cups for instant coffee are good for the environment and would rather not contribute to the plastic issue. Moreover, 90% of guests don’t use the coffee. There is a bodega two buildings over and they sell big cups of coffee for around $2.00.  SMOKING: Guests may only smoke outside of the building. If smoking, PLEASE DO NOT stand in front of the gate, stand off to the side.EARLY CHECK-IN (not earlier than 11:30am*) and LATE CHECKOUT (not later than 2:30pm*) is accommodated on a first requested, first accommodated basis. Earlier check-in and later checkout are available, but this depends on the previous/next reservations check-in/checkout time and if they asked before you—JUST ASK.Guest accessGUESTS ONLY HAVE ACCESS to the apartment. Guests SHOULD NOT wander into the staircase foyer, up to any other floor, or into the basement. BY BOOKING, entire reservations agree to these terms and, if broken, waive their right to any legal or insurance claim.Other things to note1. THE ONLY GUESTS ALLOWED IN THE APARTMENT MUST BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESERVATION. NO UNAUTHORIZED GUESTS allowed in the building or in the apartment. 2. Guests CANNOT HAVE PARTIES.3. Guests are NOT PERMITTED to use the apartment for any type of extracurricular commercial activities or filming without the express, written approval of the Host. 4. The property manager checks the apartment in the mornings, afternoons, and evenings--randomly. PLEASE NOTE: Property manager will not enter the apartment without express permission from occupying guests, unless extenuating circumstances permits.5. There is also HIDDEN SURVEILLANCE CAMERA on the outside of the apartment that monitors the flow of individuals in and out of the apartment. PLEASE BE ADVISED: If these rules are broken, the Host WILL CANCEL your reservation immediately and WILL NOT issue a refund.6. If a guest loses the keys or locks them inside the apartment, the guest is responsible for the costs associated with remediating the issue. This includes, but is not limited to, (1) paying for the property manager to Uber/Lyft from Queens (a roughly thirty-five minute ride) to the apartment (and back to Queens), (2) paying your own way to meet the property manager in Queens, or (3) (worst case scenario) paying for a locksmith to come out and “break the lock” (guests are liable for any fees associated with replacing the locks and keys as a result of “breaking the lock”)./ Centrally-located, safe STUDIO apartment one block from the Theatre District and two blocks from Times Square.
