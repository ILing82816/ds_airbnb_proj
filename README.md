# Data Science Airbnb Price Estimator: Project Overview
* Created a tool that estimates data science house rent price (MAE ~$1) to help host realize house rent in the future when they want to participate Airbnb.
* Scraped over 1000 house descriptions from airbnb using python and beautifulsoup
* Engineered features from categorical objects to encode by using CatBoost Encoding, and from the customers review of each house to quantify the value house.
* Optimized Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost tuning parameters to reach the best model.
* Displyed a variable importance using shap.
* Built a client facing API using flask

## Code and Resources Used
**Python Version:** 3.7  
**Packages:** urllib, bs4, pandas, numpy, category_encoders, vaderSentiment, sklearn, xgboost, shap, matplotlib, seaborn, flask, json, pickle  
**For Web Framework Requirements:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`    
**Flask Productionization:** https://towardsdatascience.com/productionize-a-machine-learning-model-with-flask-and-heroku-8201260503d2  

## Web Scraping
built up a web scarper by using beautifulsoup to scrape 1000 house postings from airbnb.com. With each house, we got the following:
* Name
* Location
* Type of room
* Amenities
* Review
* Price

## Data Cleaning
After scraping the data, I needed to clean it up so that it was usable for our model. I made the following changes and created the following variables:
* Parsed location out of house text
* Made columns for host provided how many room, beds, and baths
* Made a new column for the capacity of house 
* Parsed numeric data out of price
* Add column for the review sentiment analysis
* Add column for encoding the categorical objects, Location and Type of room.  

## EDA
I looked at the distributions of the data and the value counts for the various categorical variables. Below are a few highlights from the pivot tables.  
The pivot table of location and type of room:

## Model Building
First, I split the data into train and tests sets with a test size of 20%.  
I tried three different models and evaluated them using Mean Absolute Error. I chose MAE because it is relatively easy to interpret and outliers arenâ€™t particularly bad in for this type of model.  
I tried three different models:  
* **Linear Regression** - Baseline for the model
* **Random Forest** - Because of the sparse data from the many categorical variables, I thought a decision tree model like random forest would be effective.
* **XGBoost** -Again, with the sparsity associated with the data, I thought that this would be a good fit.   

## Model performance
The XGBoost model far outperformed the other approaches on the test and validation sets.
* **XGBoost:** MAE = 1.11

* **Linear Regression:** MAE = 9.86

* **Random Forest:** MAE = 2.26

Depand on the variable importance plot, we can see the "Location_cb" is the most important variable to impact the prediction. In the future, host or customer can choose different location to choose the hourse. Therefore, there are different rent of house.

## Productionization
In this step, I built a flask API endpoint that was hosted on a local webserver by following along with the tutorial in the reference section above. The API endpoint takes in a request with the information of house and returns a list of estimated rent of house.
